# Welcome to Robustoâ€™s site on GitHub! #

## Vision
*A world where no tech builder has to choose between security, redundancy, maintainability and low cost.*
## Mission
*Provide a foundation for redundant and adaptive communication, monitoring, control and automation without relying on expensive components.*

# What is Robusto?
Robusto is a framework that in some ways tries to rethink IoT development to produce cheap and robust networks, applications and services on microcontrollers.<br /> 

Features include:
* Communication
  * redundant communication
    * central in/out queues and independent queues per media
    * I2C, ESP-NOW, LoRa (and a little bit of UMTS/Cellular)
    * scoring media
  * peer management
    * presentation, information exchange
    * problem solving
  * retries over multple medias
  * fragmentation large messages
* Management
  * energy
    * sleeping
    * synchronized sleep patterns
  * KConfig/Menuconfig (not only for ESP-IDF, but also for Arduino, STM32)
  * monitoring / reporting / statistics
  * services
  * runlevels
* Technical
  * flash support
  * logging
* Misc
  * UMTS/GSM gateway
  * Publisher subscriber
